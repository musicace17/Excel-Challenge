# Excel-Challenge


# Timing explanation:
Due to a misunderstanding of the due date (not being observant of EST vs CST differences) and prior scheduling constraints the first two weeks of class, the module challenge was started late and unfinished by the due date on my end. After emailing with Jesse, an extension to class-time Thurs, Sep 14 was given.

All code is original, however a lot of time was spent on trying to get the results desired for the color grading of the Percentage column ("O"). After a lot of time spent with different resources online, still no result was found so in a 'huddle' with Lindsey Jessurun, we performed a lot of trial and error with my conditional formatting options and eventually got a result closer to the guide provided in the assessment instructions.

Due to my first attempt at the statistical analysis being accurate but not matching the exact formatting of the image provided, I made a second sheet and performed it in a different way to get results and formatting more like the resource provided.
